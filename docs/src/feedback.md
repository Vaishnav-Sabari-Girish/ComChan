# Feedback 

Thank you for using ComChan, I really appreciate you giving your time to read the full documentation.

Please give me your feedback on what you think of ComChan. 

I have created a form using `bashform` for everyone to give feedback via the terminal itself (For those who do not want to use it, they can contact me through all the social media links given in my [profile](https://github.com/Vaishnav-Sabari-Girish))

## Feedback form

Open your terminal and paste the below command 

```bash
ssh -t bashform.me f comchan
```
